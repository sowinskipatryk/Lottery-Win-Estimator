This simple program is designed to draw lots and plot on graphs using the Matplotlib library how many attempts n people had to make to win the Lotto jackpot, and what the deviation from the average number of draws needed to win (probability) is after taking n people into account. The program is supposed to have two versions - a static version that will execute the program and throw the result when it is finished, and a dynamic version that will draw data on a graph in real time.
